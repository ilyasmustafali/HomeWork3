        <p>In our third group project in which we were supposed to create a website, each of us tackled the basics of web development on Codeacademy, HTML, CSS and JS became our companions as we familiarized ourselves with building blocks of websites. <br/>
            As soon as everyone finished their individual part, we got together to split the work parts to finish the project successfully as a team effort and because we needed to come up with a team name, we named our team "TechDragons".</br>After that, Fidan Majnunova created the team 6`s Github page and as soon as she created the Github, all the team members joined team 6. Our collaboration made it possible to handle the daily commitments needed on Github. </br>
            <br/>We decided to write the codes of the website on Visual Studio Code since it was not a very comfortable experience to write everything on Github. As you can realize in the homepage, a prominent feature gracing the top of our website is the dynamic marquee showcasing our team`s name, "TechDragons". We though that marquee, which has subtle yet appealing movement, gives the homepage a little personality and energy.<br/> It draws visitors in the right way and creates an inviting atmosphere for their visit to the website. Apart from that, on our website, when users click on the names of other pages, for example altering your website from homepage to the page of Hour of Code event, they are seamlessly transported to their own destination. However, to ensure a smooth and visually appealing transition, a sand clock quickly emerges on the screen, signaling the passage of time as the name page loads. <br/>We thought, rather than just presenting users with a typical loading screen, the sand clock captivates their attention and encourages them to wait and stay engaged until the next page opens. 
            In conclusion, as we reflect on our group project, we created a website that we believe will leave a lasting impression on our visitors.<br/> We hope whoever enters our website will exit happily from the page, all our members` dedication made this website created and carefully organized. In the future, we look forward to working on other projects like this.
